# Eye-Disease-Detection-using-VGG16
For illness identification in medical pictures, image processing is important. These illness
detection and classification techniques are unique to each human organ and picture type. It is possible to
automate and/or aid doctors in clinical diagnosis by using image processing and machine learning
methods. This article explains how to identify eye disorders using different image processing and machine
learning methods. The suggested deep neural network model aids in the early detection of illnesses
including Cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy, and Glaucoma. It may prompt people to seek the advice of an
ophthalmologist for a screening. The suggested CNN model is simpler, more precise, and quicker.
